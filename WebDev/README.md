# Simple Responsive Biography Webpage

This project is a simple, responsive biography webpage with a Wikipedia-like structure. It includes collapsible sections, smooth scrolling, and an auto-generated Table of Contents (TOC). The page is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Collapsible Sections**: Clicking on any section or subsection header (like "Early Life" or "First Job") toggles the display of the content under that section.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Clicking a link in the Table of Contents smoothly scrolls the page to the corresponding section and automatically expands it.
- **Table of Contents (TOC)**: A dynamically linked TOC that allows users to navigate the page easily.

## Structure

- **HTML (`index.html`)**: Contains the main structure of the page, including sections like Early Life, Career, and Personal Life.
- **CSS (`styles.css`)**: Defines the page's layout, colors, and styles for a clean, minimalistic look.
- **JavaScript (`scripts.js`)**: Handles the collapsible section logic and smooth scrolling.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. Use the Table of Contents to navigate through different sections of the page.
3. Click on section headers to collapse or expand the content as needed.

## Requirements

No additional dependencies are required. The project only relies on standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
