# A Simple webpage
This project is a simple, responsive biography webpage with a Wikipedia-like structure. It includes collapsible sections, smooth scrolling, and an auto-generated table of contents (TOC). The page is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


## Features
- **Collapsible Sections:** Clicking on any section or subsection header (like "Early Life" or "First Job") toggles the display of the content under that section.
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Clicking a link in the Table of Contents smoothly scrolls the page to the corresponding section and automatically expands it.
- **Table of Contents (TOC):** A dynamically linked TOC that allows users to navigate the page easily.

## Structure
- **HTML (index.html):** The main structure of the page, which includes sections like Early Life, Career, and Personal Life.
- **CSS (styles.css):** Defines the page's layout, colors, and styles for a clean, minimalistic look.
- **JavaScript (scripts.js):** Handles the collapsible section logic and smooth scrolling.
